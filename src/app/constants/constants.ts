	"I am 67 years old and proud to have been the mum of two wonderful sons. Tragically, I lost my eldest son in September 2024—a loss that has left a deep mark on my heart. My youngest son, however, brings immense joy to my life. He has a loving partner and a delightful young son, and together they mean the world to me.For the past 34 years, I have dedicated myself to running charities, a role that has brought purpose and fulfilment to my life.My passions include gardening, where I find peace and connection to nature, as well as reading, art, and craft. I also enjoy writing poetry—a creative outlet that helps me express my thoughts and feelings.";
